# Creator Rewards Platform - Vibe Coin Integration

## Overview

The Creator Rewards Platform has been designed to use **Vibe Coin** as the payment token for empowering African creators by linking their social media activity with direct on-chain payouts. This implementation integrates with an existing Vibe Coin token rather than creating a custom token.

## Smart Contract Architecture

### CreatorRewardsContract.sol

The main smart contract that handles:
- **Vibe Coin Integration**: Uses IERC20 interface to interact with existing Vibe Coin token
- **Creator Verification**: Staking mechanism for creator verification
- **Reward Distribution**: Direct Vibe Coin transfers to creators
- **Platform Management**: Administrative functions for platform operations

### Key Features

1. **Vibe Coin Payment System**: All rewards are distributed in Vibe Coin tokens
2. **Staking Verification**: Creators stake Vibe Coin to get verified on the platform
3. **Transparent Rewards**: All transactions recorded on-chain for transparency
4. **Platform Analytics**: Track total rewards, creators, and staking statistics

## Smart Contract Functions

### Core Functions

- `stakeForVerification(uint256 amount)`: Creators stake Vibe Coin for verification
- `distributeReward(address creator, uint256 amount, string rewardId)`: Distribute Vibe Coin rewards
- `addRewardTokens(uint256 amount)`: Platform adds Vibe Coin to reward pool
- `getCreatorEarnings(address creator)`: Get creator's total earnings
- `getPlatformStats()`: Get platform statistics

### View Functions

- `getContractVibeCoinBalance()`: Check contract's Vibe Coin balance
- `getVibeCoinAddress()`: Get the Vibe Coin token address
- `totalRewardsDistributed()`: Total rewards distributed
- `totalCreators()`: Number of verified creators
- `totalStaked()`: Total Vibe Coin staked

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Blockchain Configuration
BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... # Your deployed contract address
VIBE_COIN_ADDRESS=0x... # Existing Vibe Coin token address
BLOCKCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... # Platform wallet private key
CONTRACT_ABI=[] # Contract ABI JSON
BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=ethereum
GAS_LIMIT=500000
GAS_PRICE=20
```

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **Vibe Coin Token Address**: Get the deployed Vibe Coin contract address
2. **Platform Wallet**: Ethereum wallet with ETH for gas fees
3. **Deployment Environment**: Node.js, Hardhat/Truffle, or Remix

### Contract Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Constructor Parameters**:
   ```solidity
   constructor(address _vibeCoinAddress, address _platformWallet)
   ```
   - `_vibeCoinAddress`: The deployed Vibe Coin token contract address
   - `_platformWallet`: Platform wallet address for administrative functions

2. **Deploy Contract**:
   ```bash
   # Using Hardhat
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
   
   # Or using Remix IDE
   # 1. Load CreatorRewardsContract.sol
   # 2. Compile with Solidity ^0.8.19
   # 3. Deploy with constructor parameters
   ```

3. **Verify Contract**: Verify the contract on Etherscan for transparency

4. **Update Environment**: Set the deployed contract address in `.env`

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Update with your actual values
   ```

3. **Generate Contract ABI**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the ABI from compilation output to CONTRACT_ABI
   # Or use the provided CreatorRewardsToken.abi.json
   ```

4. **Start Backend**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Vibe Coin Integration Details

### Token Operations

1. **Reward Distribution**:
   ```solidity
   function distributeReward(address creator, uint256 amount, string memory rewardId) external onlyPlatform {
       require(vibeCoin.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount, "Insufficient contract balance");
       require(vibeCoin.transfer(creator, amount), "Transfer failed");
       // ... event emission and tracking
   }
   ```

2. **Staking for Verification**:
   ```solidity
   function stakeForVerification(uint256 amount) external {
       require(vibeCoin.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Transfer failed");
       // ... verification logic
   }
   ```

3. **Adding Reward Tokens**:
   ```solidity
   function addRewardTokens(uint256 amount) external onlyPlatform {
       require(vibeCoin.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Transfer failed");
       // ... tracking logic
   }
   ```

### Backend Integration

The NestJS backend provides REST APIs for:

- **Creator Management**: Register, verify, and manage creators
- **Reward Processing**: Calculate and distribute rewards
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Smart contract integration
- **Analytics**: Platform and creator statistics

### API Endpoints

```
POST /creators/:id/verify - Verify creator with staking
POST /rewards/:id/distribute - Distribute reward to creator
GET /platform/stats - Get platform blockchain statistics
GET /creators/:id/earnings - Get creator earnings
POST /platform/add-tokens - Add Vibe Coin to reward pool
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**: Only platform wallet can distribute rewards
2. **Balance Checks**: Ensure sufficient contract balance before transfers
3. **Transfer Validation**: Check transfer success for all operations
4. **Event Logging**: All operations emit events for transparency
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs and addresses

## Testing

### Local Testing

1. **Deploy to Local Network**:
   ```bash
   # Start local blockchain
   npx hardhat node
   
   # Deploy contracts
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

2. **Test Contract Functions**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Test Backend Integration**:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

### Testnet Deployment

Deploy to Goerli or Sepolia testnet before mainnet:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### On-Chain Monitoring

- Monitor contract Vibe Coin balance
- Track reward distribution events
- Watch for failed transactions
- Monitor gas usage patterns

### Backend Monitoring

- API response times
- Database performance
- Blockchain connection health
- Error rates and logging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Contract Balance**: 
   - Check contract Vibe Coin balance
   - Add more tokens using `addRewardTokens()`

2. **Transfer Failures**:
   - Verify Vibe Coin contract address
   - Check creator wallet addresses
   - Ensure sufficient gas limits

3. **Configuration Issues**:
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check contract ABI format
   - Validate network connectivity

### Support

For technical support and questions:
- Review contract events on blockchain explorer
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify environment configuration
- Test with smaller amounts first

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Chain Support**: Expand to other blockchains
2. **Advanced Staking**: Time-locked staking mechanisms
3. **Governance**: Creator voting on platform decisions
4. **Automated Rewards**: Smart contract-based automated distributions
5. **Integration APIs**: Direct social media platform integrations
